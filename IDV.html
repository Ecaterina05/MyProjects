<h2>Story</h2>
<p class="impact">
Emphasis was given to the plot and story in this game, in order to help players be more immersed and be more attached, especially considering how a large number of players were female. 
The team continuously received feedback from players from Weibo comments, which enabled the team to flesh out more details earlier in development.

<h2>Game Setup</h2>
<h3>Normal matches</h3>
<p class="impact">
A match usually has 5 players. One is the Hunter, and others are called Survivors.
Each Hunter has their own skill and a Secondary skill, while Survivors have their own skill and talent too.
Both of them have a persona, which can help the player make their character better in many faces.
Hunters win when they kill more than 2 Survivors. Survivors win if more than 2 people escape.
When 2 Survivors escape, and 2 others die, there will be a Tie.
While the Hunters try to find and kill Survivors, Survivors have to decode 5 Cipher machines to have a secret password to escape.
When they finish decoding 2 machines, the dungeon will be revealed, which can only be opened when 1 Survivor is left.
</p>

<h3>Other modes</h3>
<p class="impact">
There are a few other modes with different rules, such as: Duo Hunters, where there are two Hunters teaming up against and eight survivors; Blackjack, which mostly plays like regular Blackjack, 
with the twist being that one of the players will become a Hunter; and Tarot, where three Survivors and a Hunter team up against another team, whose goal is to eliminate the King.
</p>

<h3>Logic Path and Essences</h3>
<p class="impact">
The secondary mode is a Gacha-like system involving cosmetics. 
The Logic Path has a paper detective running across a board game-like path when dice is rolled.
Dice can be obtained by playing matches.
The second section involves Essences. 
The rewards include Costumes (some of which includes a free character), Accessories (some of which alter effects or even includes exclusive emotes), 
Pets (which will follow the player character), Behavior (which includes Emotes and Graffiti), and waiting room stances.

<h2>Visuals and Audio</h2>
<p class="impact">
The initial art style of game game was more grim and horrific, but the more hardcore nature of the game and its horror elements also meant a smaller audience. Following internal discussion with the project team, art team, and producer Shota (then-teacher), they decided to broaden their audience by changing the art style. The audio, including the cello sounds and drumming heartbeats, 
was made to build excitement and tension.

<h2>Inspiration and Collaboration</h2>
<p class="impact">
According to the two new game planners associated with the game, the idea for a asymmetrical game spawned from their experiences with MOBA games like Dota 2.
The market for MOBA games was already too saturated with little space for innovation, 
so they decided to create a game in a smaller subgenre of competitive games: 
an asymmetrical competitive game. The purpose of the project was to simply to bring players 
enjoyment, so there were no expectations for how such a game, especially one that was more hardcore than casual, would perform.
</p>
<br>
<p class="impact">
Due to their inexperience, the game planners didn't realize long-term thematic issues while they were pre-occupied with the gameplay, which was closer to a battle royale at the time. As such the worldview was lacking during the first mini project review. This was remedied and the game, after becoming Identity V, 
came to have a solid setting depcited like a mystery novel.
</p>
<br>
<h4>Working with Behaviour Interactive (BHVR)</h4>
<p class="impact">
During the closed beta tests of the Chinese version, NetEase was in talks with Behaviour (the creators of Dead by Daylight) for rights to use some of its game mechanisms, and difficulties that were eventually resolved. Details of the collaboration was restricted to some employees and contracted streamers until BHVR's
official announcement that they were assissting Netease with Identity V.
